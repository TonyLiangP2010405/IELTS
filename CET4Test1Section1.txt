right, well I afraid the schedule hasn't been printed out yet but we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits, which you can also book in advance if you want to
if you can just give some ideas of the weekend ones so I can you know work out when to see friends etcetera
oh the first one is St lves
that is on thirteenth of February and we will have only sixteen places available because we're going by minibus.
and that is a day in town and with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum
then there's a London trip on the sixteen of Februray and we'll be taking medium-size coach so there will be 45 place on that and let's see the optinal extra is tower of London 
oh I've already been there.
that's in a different minibus with 18 places available and the end optional extra is a visit to the ss great Britian
we're going to Salisbury on eighteen of March and that's always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge so we take a large coach with fifty seats...
and then the last one is to bath on the twenty-third of March
it is bath the Roman city?
that is right and that is in the sixteen seater minibus
and where's the optional visit ?
it's to the American museum well worth a visit? 
by the way if you want more information about any of trips have a look in the student newspaper.
